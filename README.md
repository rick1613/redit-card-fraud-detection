Credit Card Fraud Detection

Overview

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The project utilizes machine learning models to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on various transaction features.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains anonymized credit card transactions with features such as transaction amount, time, and various numerical inputs. The dataset includes both fraudulent and legitimate transactions for training and evaluation purposes.

Project Files
	•	credit_card_model.pkl – Trained machine learning model for fraud detection.
	•	Final_Capstone.ipynb – Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
	•	README.md – This document, explaining the project.
	•	Credit Card Fraud Detection.jpg – Project visualization or related image.
	•	Find default (1).pdf – Reference document related to fraud detection.

Installation
	1.	Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/rick1613/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection


	2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt



Usage
	1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook Final Capstone.ipynb.
	2.	Follow the notebook instructions for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
	3.	Load the trained model (credit_card_model.pkl) for making predictions.

Model
	•	The machine learning model used for fraud detection is stored in credit_card_model.pkl.
	•	The model was trained using supervised learning techniques and evaluated for accuracy and precision in fraud classification.
